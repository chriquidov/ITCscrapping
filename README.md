## Project purpose 
---
In this project we tried to extract as much data as possible from the website [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=Data%20Scientist&l=United%20States&vjk=92ecfcf3e426868a), in which one can find a big amount of job offers, including lots of information regarding the job.

## Results
---
For now the Results are stored in a csv file that one can check in the csv file [job.csv](https://github.com/chriquidov/ITCscrapping/blob/dov_dev/jobs3.csv), where one can see the different information we gathered till now aboutevery job offer, *we intend to add more information about the job offer that we will gather from the link that's already in the csv file*. 
## Instructions

The repository contains a requirements.txt file in which one can find the required packages to be able to pu to work the scrapping. 
Once the repository cloned, running the ```indeed_scrapping_checkpoint_1.py```, the user is required to provide a minimum number of job offers to scrape, once done the program displays the first five rows of the created dataset.
